//! Standard Dark and Light themes, the Gnome Adwaita colorscheme
//! was chosen as the base for these themes, as they look good,
//! and should look at home on a modern Windows and Mac Desktop environment.
//!
//! The [`egui_aesthetix::themes::StandardDark`] and [`egui_aesthetix::themes::StandardLight`]
//! structs are good examples on how to implement a theme you want using the
//! [`egui_aesthetix::Aesthetix`] trait.
